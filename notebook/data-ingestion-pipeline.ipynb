We use techniques from volume\\nrendering to accumulate samples of this scene representation along rays to render\\nthe scene from any viewpoint. Here, we visualize the set of 100 input views of the\\nsynthetic Drums scene randomly captured on a surrounding hemisphere, and we\\nshow two novel views rendered from our optimized NeRF representation.\\nfrom a particular viewpoint we: 1) march camera rays through the scene to\\ngenerate a sampled set of 3D points, 2) use those points and their corresponding\\n2D viewing directions as input to the neural network to produce an output\\nset of colors and densities, and 3) use classical volume rendering techniques to\\naccumulate those colors and densities into a 2D image. Because this process is\\nnaturally diﬀerentiable, we can use gradient descent to optimize this model by\\nminimizing the error between each observed image and the corresponding views\\nrendered from our representation. Minimizing this error across multiple views\\nencourages the network to predict a coherent model of the scene by assigning\\nhigh volume densities and accurate colors to the locations that contain the true\\nunderlying scene content. Figure 2 visualizes this overall pipeline.\\nWe ﬁnd that the basic implementation of optimizing a neural radiance ﬁeld\\nrepresentation for a complex scene does not converge to a suﬃciently high-\\nresolution representation and is ineﬃcient in the required number of samples per\\ncamera ray. We address these issues by transforming input 5D coordinates with\\na positional encoding that enables the MLP to represent higher frequency func-\\ntions, and we propose a hierarchical sampling procedure to reduce the number of\\nqueries required to adequately sample this high-frequency scene representation.\\nOur approach inherits the beneﬁts of volumetric representations: both can\\nrepresent complex real-world geometry and appearance and are well suited for\\ngradient-based optimization using projected images. Crucially, our method over-\\ncomes the prohibitive storage costs of discretized voxel grids when modeling\\ncomplex scenes at high-resolutions. In summary, our technical contributions are:\\n– An approach for representing continuous scenes with complex geometry and\\nmaterials as 5D neural radiance ﬁelds, parameterized as basic MLP networks.\\n– A diﬀerentiable rendering procedure based on classical volume rendering tech-\\nniques, which we use to optimize these representations from standard RGB\\nimages. This includes a hierarchical sampling strategy to allocate the MLP’s\\ncapacity towards space with visible scene content.'),\n",

However, these methods have so far been unable to reproduce realistic\\nscenes with complex geometry with the same ﬁdelity as techniques that represent\\nscenes using discrete representations such as triangle meshes or voxel grids. In\\nthis section, we review these two lines of work and contrast them with our\\napproach, which enhances the capabilities of neural scene representations to\\nproduce state-of-the-art results for rendering complex realistic scenes.\\nA similar approach of using MLPs to map from low-dimensional coordinates\\nto colors has also been used for representing other graphics functions such as im-\\nages [44], textured materials [12,31,36,37], and indirect illumination values [38].\\nNeural 3D shape representations Recent work has investigated the im-\\nplicit representation of continuous 3D shapes as level sets by optimizing deep\\nnetworks that map xyz coordinates to signed distance functions [15,32] or occu-\\npancy ﬁelds [11,27]. However, these models are limited by their requirement of\\naccess to ground truth 3D geometry, typically obtained from synthetic 3D shape\\ndatasets such as ShapeNet [3]. Subsequent work has relaxed this requirement of\\nground truth 3D shapes by formulating diﬀerentiable rendering functions that\\nallow neural implicit shape representations to be optimized using only 2D im-\\nages. Niemeyer et al . [29] represent surfaces as 3D occupancy ﬁelds and use a\\nnumerical method to ﬁnd the surface intersection for each ray, then calculate an\\nexact derivative using implicit diﬀerentiation. Each ray intersection location is\\nprovided as the input to a neural 3D texture ﬁeld that predicts a diﬀuse color for\\nthat point. Sitzmann et al. [42] use a less direct neural 3D representation that\\nsimply outputs a feature vector and RGB color at each continuous 3D coordinate,\\nand propose a diﬀerentiable rendering function consisting of a recurrent neural\\nnetwork that marches along each ray to decide where the surface is located.\\nThough these techniques can potentially represent complicated and high-\\nresolution geometry, they have so far been limited to simple shapes with low\\ngeometric complexity, resulting in oversmoothed renderings.

For novel view synthesis with sparser view\\nsampling, the computer vision and graphics communities have made signiﬁcant\\nprogress by predicting traditional geometry and appearance representations from\\nobserved images. One popular class of approaches uses mesh-based representa-\\ntions of scenes with either diﬀuse [48] or view-dependent [2,8,49] appearance.\\nDiﬀerentiable rasterizers [4,10,23,25] or pathtracers [22,30] can directly optimize\\nmesh representations to reproduce a set of input images using gradient descent.\\nHowever, gradient-based mesh optimization based on image reprojection is often\\ndiﬃcult, likely because of local minima or poor conditioning of the loss land-\\nscape. Furthermore, this strategy requires a template mesh with ﬁxed topology\\nto be provided as an initialization before optimization [22], which is typically\\nunavailable for unconstrained real-world scenes.\\nAnother class of methods use volumetric representations to address the task\\nof high-quality photorealistic view synthesis from a set of input RGB images.\\nVolumetric approaches are able to realistically represent complex shapes and\\nmaterials, are well-suited for gradient-based optimization, and tend to produce\\nless visually distracting artifacts than mesh-based methods. Early volumetric\\napproaches used observed images to directly color voxel grids [19,40,45]. More\\nrecently, several methods [9,13,17,28,33,43,46,52] have used large datasets of mul-\\ntiple scenes to train deep networks that predict a sampled volumetric represen-\\ntation from a set of input images, and then use either alpha-compositing [34] or\\nlearned compositing along rays to render novel views at test time. Other works\\nhave optimized a combination of convolutional networks (CNNs) and sampled\\nvoxel grids for each speciﬁc scene, such that the CNN can compensate for dis-\\ncretization artifacts from low resolution voxel grids [41] or allow the predicted\\nvoxel grids to vary based on input time or animation controls [24]. While these\\nvolumetric techniques have achieved impressive results for novel view synthe-\\nsis, their ability to scale to higher resolution imagery is fundamentally limited\\nby poor time and space complexity due to their discrete sampling — rendering\\nhigher resolution images requires a ﬁner sampling of 3D space. We circumvent\\nthis problem by instead encoding a continuous volume within the parameters\\nof a deep fully-connected neural network, which not only produces signiﬁcantly\\nhigher quality renderings than prior volumetric approaches, but also requires\\njust a fraction of the storage cost of those sampled volumetric representations.\\n3 Neural Radiance Field Scene Representation\\nWe represent a continuous scene as a 5D vector-valued function whose input is\\na 3D location x = (x,y,z ) and 2D viewing direction ( θ,φ), and whose output\\nis an emitted color c = (r,g,b ) and volume density σ.

However, we observe that these components are not suﬃcient for\\nachieving state-of-the-art quality, as demonstrated in Section 6.4).

The\\nﬁrst is a positional encoding of the input coordinates that assists the MLP in\\nrepresenting high-frequency functions, and the second is a hierarchical sampling\\nprocedure that allows us to eﬃciently sample this high-frequency representation.\\n5.1 Positional encoding\\nDespite the fact that neural networks are universal function approximators [14],\\nwe found that having the network FΘ directly operate on xyzθφ input coordi-\\nnates results in renderings that perform poorly at representing high-frequency\\nvariation in color and geometry. This is consistent with recent work by Rahaman\\net al. [35], which shows that deep networks are biased towards learning lower fre-\\nquency functions. They additionally show that mapping the inputs to a higher\\ndimensional space using high frequency functions before passing them to the\\nnetwork enables better ﬁtting of data that contains high frequency variation.\\nWe leverage these ﬁndings in the context of neural scene representations, and\\nshow that reformulating FΘ as a composition of two functions FΘ = F′\\nΘ ◦γ, one\\nlearned and one not, signiﬁcantly improves performance (see Fig. 4 and Table 2).\\nHere γ is a mapping from R into a higher dimensional space R2L, and F′\\nΘ is still\\nsimply a regular MLP.

However, Transformers use it for a\\ndiﬀerent goal of providing the discrete positions of tokens in a sequence as input\\nto an architecture that does not contain any notion of order. In contrast, we use\\nthese functions to map continuous input coordinates into a higher dimensional\\nspace to enable our MLP to more easily approximate a higher frequency function.\\nConcurrent work on a related problem of modeling 3D protein structure from\\nprojections [51] also utilizes a similar input coordinate mapping.\\n5.2 Hierarchical volume sampling\\nOur rendering strategy of densely evaluating the neural radiance ﬁeld network\\nat N query points along each camera ray is ineﬃcient: free space and occluded\\nregions that do not contribute to the rendered image are still sampled repeat-\\nedly. We draw inspiration from early work in volume rendering [20] and propose\\na hierarchical representation that increases rendering eﬃciency by allocating\\nsamples proportionally to their expected eﬀect on the ﬁnal rendering.\\nInstead of just using a single network to represent the scene, we simultane-\\nously optimize two networks: one “coarse” and one “ﬁne”. We ﬁrst sample a set\\nof Nc locations using stratiﬁed sampling, and evaluate the “coarse” network at\\nthese locations as described in Eqns. 2 and 3. Given the output of this “coarse”\\nnetwork, we then produce a more informed sampling of points along each ray\\nwhere samples are biased towards the relevant parts of the volume. To do this,\\nwe ﬁrst rewrite the alpha composited color from the coarse network ˆCc(r) in\\nEqn. 3 as a weighted sum of all sampled colors ci along the ray:\\nˆCc(r) =\\nNc∑\\ni=1\\nwici , w i = Ti(1 −exp(−σiδi)) . (5)\\nNormalizing these weights as ˆ wi = wi/∑Nc\\nj=1 wj produces a piecewise-constant\\nPDF along the ray. We sample a second set ofNf locations from this distribution\\nusing inverse transform sampling, evaluate our “ﬁne” network at the union of the\\nﬁrst and second set of samples, and compute the ﬁnal rendered color of the ray\\nˆCf (r) using Eqn. 3 but using all Nc +Nf samples. This procedure allocates more\\nsamples to regions we expect to contain visible content. This addresses a similar\\ngoal as importance sampling, but we use the sampled values as a nonuniform\\ndiscretization of the whole integration domain rather than treating each sample\\nas an independent probabilistic estimate of the entire integral.\\n5.3 Implementation details\\nWe optimize a separate neural continuous volume representation network for\\neach scene.

All methods use the same set of input views\\nto train a separate network for each scene except Local Light Field Fusion [28],\\nwhich trains a single 3D convolutional network on a large dataset, then uses the\\nsame trained network to process input images of new scenes at test time.\\nNeural Volumes (NV)[24] synthesizes novel views of objects that lie en-\\ntirely within a bounded volume in front of a distinct background (which must\\nbe separately captured without the object of interest). It optimizes a deep 3D\\nconvolutional network to predict a discretized RGB α voxel grid with 1283 sam-\\nples as well as a 3D warp grid with 32 3 samples. The algorithm renders novel\\nviews by marching camera rays through the warped voxel grid.\\nScene Representation Networks (SRN)[42] represent a continuous scene\\nas an opaque surface, implicitly deﬁned by a MLP that maps each ( x,y,z ) co-\\nordinate to a feature vector. They train a recurrent neural network to march\\nalong a ray through the scene representation by using the feature vector at any\\n3D coordinate to predict the next step size along the ray. The feature vector\\nfrom the ﬁnal step is decoded into a single color for that point on the surface.\\nNote that SRN is a better-performing followup to DeepVoxels [41] by the same\\nauthors, which is why we do not include comparisons to DeepVoxels.'),\n",

Furthermore, we produce qualitatively\\nand quantitatively superior renderings compared to LLFF (across all except one\\nmetric) while using only their input images as our entire training set.\\nThe SRN method produces heavily smoothed geometry and texture, and its\\nrepresentational power for view synthesis is limited by selecting only a single\\ndepth and color per camera ray. The NV baseline is able to capture reasonably\\ndetailed volumetric geometry and appearance, but its use of an underlying ex-\\nplicit 1283 voxel grid prevents it from scaling to represent ﬁne details at high\\nresolutions. LLFF speciﬁcally provides a “sampling guideline” to not exceed 64\\npixels of disparity between input views, so it frequently fails to estimate cor-\\nrect geometry in the synthetic datasets which contain up to 400-500 pixels of\\ndisparity between views. Additionally, LLFF blends between diﬀerent scene rep-\\nresentations for rendering diﬀerent views, resulting in perceptually-distracting\\ninconsistency as is apparent in our supplementary video.\\nThe biggest practical tradeoﬀs between these methods are time versus space.\\nAll compared single scene methods take at least 12 hours to train per scene. In\\ncontrast, LLFF can process a small input dataset in under 10 minutes. However,\\nLLFF produces a large 3D voxel grid for every input image, resulting in enor-\\nmous storage requirements (over 15GB for one “Realistic Synthetic” scene). Our\\nmethod requires only 5 MB for the network weights (a relative compression of\\n3000×compared to LLFF), which is even less memory than the input images\\nalone for a single scene from any of our datasets.\\n6.4 Ablation studies\\nWe validate our algorithm’s design choices and parameters with an extensive\\nablation study in Table 2.

In rows 2–4 we remove these\\nthree components one at a time from the full model, observing that positional\\nencoding (row 2) and view-dependence (row 3) provide the largest quantitative\\nbeneﬁt followed by hierarchical sampling (row 4). Rows 5–6 show how our per-\\nformance decreases as the number of input images is reduced. Note that our\\nmethod’s performance using only 25 input images still exceeds NV, SRN, and\\nLLFF across all metrics when they are provided with 100 images (see supple-\\nmentary material).

We demonstrate that represent-\\ning scenes as 5D neural radiance ﬁelds (an MLP that outputs volume density and\\nview-dependent emitted radiance as a function of 3D location and 2D viewing\\ndirection) produces better renderings than the previously-dominant approach of\\ntraining deep convolutional networks to output discretized voxel representations.\\nAlthough we have proposed a hierarchical sampling strategy to make render-\\ning more sample-eﬃcient (for both training and testing), there is still much more\\nprogress to be made in investigating techniques to eﬃciently optimize and ren-\\nder neural radiance ﬁelds. Another direction for future work is interpretability:\\nsampled representations such as voxel grids and meshes admit reasoning about\\nthe expected quality of rendered views and failure modes, but it is unclear how\\nto analyze these issues when we encode scenes in the weights of a deep neural\\nnetwork. We believe that this work makes progress towards a graphics pipeline\\nbased on real world imagery, where complex scenes could be composed of neural\\nradiance ﬁelds optimized from images of actual objects and scenes.\\nAcknowledgements We thank Kevin Cao, Guowei Frank Yang, and Nithin\\nRaghavan for comments and discussions.

ACM Transactions on Graphics (SIG-\\nGRAPH) (2018)\\nA Additional Implementation Details\\nNetwork ArchitectureFig. 7 details our simple fully-connected architecture.\\nVolume Bounds Our method renders views by querying the neural radiance\\nﬁeld representation at continuous 5D coordinates along camera rays. For exper-\\niments with synthetic images, we scale the scene so that it lies within a cube of\\nside length 2 centered at the origin, and only query the representation within\\nthis bounding volume. Our dataset of real images contains content that can ex-\\nist anywhere between the closest point and inﬁnity, so we use normalized device\\ncoordinates to map the depth range of these points into [ −1,1]. This shifts all\\nthe ray origins to the near plane of the scene, maps the perspective rays of the\\ncamera to parallel rays in the transformed volume, and uses disparity (inverse\\ndepth) instead of metric depth, so all coordinates are now bounded.\\nTraining Details For real scene data, we regularize our network by adding\\nrandom Gaussian noise with zero mean and unit variance to the output σvalues\\n(before passing them through the ReLU) during optimization, ﬁnding that this\\nslightly improves visual performance for rendering novel views. We implement\\nour model in Tensorﬂow [1].\\nRendering DetailsTo render new views at test time, we sample 64 points per\\nray through the coarse network and 64 + 128 = 192 points per ray through the\\nﬁne network, for a total of 256 network queries per ray.

We compute quantitative metrics for SRN at 512 ×512 pixels for our\\nsynthetic datasets and 504 ×376 pixels for the real datasets, in comparison to\\n800 ×800 and 1008 ×752 respectively for the other methods that can be run at\\nhigher resolutions.\\nC NDC ray space derivation\\nWe reconstruct real scenes with “forward facing” captures in the normalized\\ndevice coordinate (NDC) space that is commonly used as part of the triangle\\nrasterization pipeline. This space is convenient because it preserves parallel lines\\nwhile converting the z axis (camera axis) to be linear in disparity.\\nHere we derive the transformation which is applied to rays to map them from\\ncamera space to NDC space. The standard 3D perspective projection matrix for\\nhomogeneous coordinates is:\\nM =\\n\\uf8eb\\n\\uf8ec\\uf8ec\\uf8ed\\nn\\nr 0 0 0\\n0 n\\nt 0 0\\n0 0 −(f+n)\\nf−n\\n−2fn\\nf−n\\n0 0 −1 0\\n\\uf8f6\\n\\uf8f7\\uf8f7\\uf8f8 (7)\\nwhere n,f are the near and far clipping planes and rand tare the right and top\\nbounds of the scene at the near clipping plane. (Note that this is in the convention\\nwhere the camera is looking in the−zdirection.) To project a homogeneous point\\n(x,y,z, 1)⊤, we left-multiply by M and then divide by the fourth coordinate:\\n\\uf8eb\\n\\uf8ec\\uf8ec\\uf8ed\\nn\\nr 0 0 0\\n0 n\\nt 0 0\\n0 0 −(f+n)\\nf−n\\n−2fn\\nf−n\\n0 0 −1 0\\n\\uf8f6\\n\\uf8f7\\uf8f7\\uf8f8\\n\\uf8eb\\n\\uf8ec\\uf8ec\\uf8ed\\nx\\ny\\nz\\n1\\n\\uf8f6\\n\\uf8f7\\uf8f7\\uf8f8=\\n\\uf8eb\\n\\uf8ec\\uf8ec\\uf8ed\\nn\\nr x\\nn\\nt y\\n−(f+n)\\nf−n z−−2fn\\nf−n\\n−z\\n\\uf8f6\\n\\uf8f7\\uf8f7\\uf8f8 (8)\\nproject →\\n\\uf8eb\\n\\uf8ec\\uf8ed\\nn\\nr\\nx\\n−zn\\nt\\ny\\n−z\\n(f+n)\\nf−n −2fn\\nf−n\\n1\\n−z\\n\\uf8f6\\n\\uf8f7\\uf8f8 (9)\\nThe projected point is now in normalized device coordinate (NDC) space, where\\nthe original viewing frustum has been mapped to the cube [ −1,1]3.\\nOur goal is to take a ray o+ td and calculate a ray origin o′and direction d′\\nin NDC space such that for every t, there exists a new t′for which π(o + td) =\\no′+ t′d′ (where π is projection using the above matrix).

Numerous\\nefforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder\\narchitectures [38, 24, 15].\\nRecurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output\\nsequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden\\nstates ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht−1 and the input for position t. This inherently\\nsequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer\\nsequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved\\nsigniﬁcant improvements in computational efﬁciency through factorization tricks [21] and conditional\\ncomputation [32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental\\nconstraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc-\\ntion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in\\nthe input or output sequences [2, 19]. In all but a few cases [27], however, such attention mechanisms\\nare used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead\\nrelying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.\\nThe Transformer allows for signiﬁcantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in\\ntranslation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\\n2 Background\\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU\\n[16], ByteNet [18] and ConvS2S [9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building\\nblock, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models,\\nthe number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows\\nin the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes\\nit more difﬁcult to learn dependencies between distant positions [ 12]. In the Transformer this is\\nreduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due\\nto averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as\\ndescribed in section 3.2.\\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions\\nof a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been\\nused successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization,\\ntextual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 27, 28, 22].\\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-\\naligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and\\nlanguage modeling tasks [34].\\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the ﬁrst transduction model relying\\nentirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-\\naligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate\\nself-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [17, 18] and [9].\\n3 Model Architecture\\nMost competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [5, 2, 35].\\nHere, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1,...,x n) to a sequence\\nof continuous representations z = (z1,...,z n). Given z, the decoder then generates an output\\nsequence (y1,...,y m) of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive\\n[10], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.\\nThe Transformer follows this overall architecture using stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully\\nconnected layers for both the encoder and decoder, shown in the left and right halves of Figure 1,\\nrespectively.\\n2'),\n",

Each layer has two\\nsub-layers. The ﬁrst is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, position-\\nwise fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection [11] around each of\\nthe two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [ 1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is\\nLayerNorm(x+ Sublayer(x)), where Sublayer(x) is the function implemented by the sub-layer\\nitself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding\\nlayers, produce outputs of dimension dmodel = 512.\\nDecoder: The decoder is also composed of a stack of N = 6identical layers. In addition to the two\\nsub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head\\nattention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections\\naround each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention\\nsub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This\\nmasking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the\\npredictions for position ican depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i.\\n3.2 Attention\\nAn attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output,\\nwhere the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors. The output is computed as a weighted sum\\nof the values, where the weight assigned to each value is computed by a compatibility function of the\\nquery with the corresponding key.\\n3'),\n",

The input consists of\\nqueries and keys of dimension dk, and values of dimension dv. We compute the dot products of the\\nquery with all keys, divide each by √dk, and apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on the\\nvalues.\\nIn practice, we compute the attention function on a set of queries simultaneously, packed together\\ninto a matrix Q. The keys and values are also packed together into matrices Kand V. We compute\\nthe matrix of outputs as:\\nAttention(Q,K,V ) = softmax(QKT\\n√dk\\n)V (1)\\nThe two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [2], and dot-product (multi-\\nplicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor\\nof 1√dk\\n. Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with\\na single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is\\nmuch faster and more space-efﬁcient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized\\nmatrix multiplication code.\\nWhile for small values of dk the two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms\\ndot product attention without scaling for larger values of dk [3]. We suspect that for large values of\\ndk, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has\\nextremely small gradients 4. To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by 1√dk\\n.\\n3.2.2 Multi-Head Attention\\nInstead of performing a single attention function with dmodel-dimensional keys, values and queries,\\nwe found it beneﬁcial to linearly project the queries, keys and values htimes with different, learned\\nlinear projections to dk, dk and dv dimensions, respectively. On each of these projected versions of\\nqueries, keys and values we then perform the attention function in parallel, yielding dv-dimensional\\noutput values. These are concatenated and once again projected, resulting in the ﬁnal values, as\\ndepicted in Figure 2.\\n4To illustrate why the dot products get large, assume that the components of q and k are independent random\\nvariables with mean 0 and variance 1. Then their dot product, q · k = ∑dk\\ni=1 qiki, has mean 0 and variance dk.\\n4'),\n",

For each of these we use\\ndk = dv = dmodel/h= 64. Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost\\nis similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.\\n3.2.3 Applications of Attention in our Model\\nThe Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\\n• In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer,\\nand the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every\\nposition in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the\\ntypical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as\\n[38, 2, 9].\\n• The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values\\nand queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the\\nencoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the\\nencoder.\\n• Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to\\nall positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward\\ninformation ﬂow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this\\ninside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to −∞) all values in the input\\nof the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.\\n3.3 Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks\\nIn addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully\\nconnected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This\\nconsists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\\nFFN(x) = max(0,xW1 + b1)W2 + b2 (2)\\nWhile the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters\\nfrom layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1.\\nThe dimensionality of input and output is dmodel = 512, and the inner-layer has dimensionality\\ndff = 2048.\\n3.4 Embeddings and Softmax\\nSimilarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input\\ntokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension dmodel. We also use the usual learned linear transfor-\\nmation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In\\nour model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax\\nlinear transformation, similar to [30]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by √dmodel.\\n3.5 Positional Encoding\\nSince our model contains no recurrence and no convolution, in order for the model to make use of the\\norder of the sequence, we must inject some information about the relative or absolute position of the\\n5'),\n",

The positional encodings have the same dimension dmodel\\nas the embeddings, so that the two can be summed.

That is, each dimension of the positional encoding\\ncorresponds to a sinusoid. The wavelengths form a geometric progression from 2πto 10000 ·2π. We\\nchose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by\\nrelative positions, since for any ﬁxed offset k, PEpos+k can be represented as a linear function of\\nPEpos.\\nWe also experimented with using learned positional embeddings [9] instead, and found that the two\\nversions produced nearly identical results (see Table 3 row (E)). We chose the sinusoidal version\\nbecause it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered\\nduring training.\\n4 Why Self-Attention\\nIn this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolu-\\ntional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations\\n(x1,...,x n) to another sequence of equal length (z1,...,z n), with xi,zi ∈Rd, such as a hidden\\nlayer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we\\nconsider three desiderata.\\nOne is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can\\nbe parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\\nThe third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range\\ndependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the\\nability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to\\ntraverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input\\nand output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [12]. Hence we also compare\\nthe maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the\\ndifferent layer types.\\nAs noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially\\nexecuted operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n) sequential operations. In terms of\\ncomputational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence\\nlength n is smaller than the representation dimensionality d, which is most often the case with\\nsentence representations used by state-of-the-art models in machine translations, such as word-piece\\n[38] and byte-pair [31] representations. To improve computational performance for tasks involving\\nvery long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size rin\\n6'),\n",

Doing so requires a stack of O(n/k) convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels,\\nor O(logk(n)) in the case of dilated convolutions [ 18], increasing the length of the longest paths\\nbetween any two positions in the network. Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than\\nrecurrent layers, by a factor of k. Separable convolutions [ 6], however, decrease the complexity\\nconsiderably, to O(k·n·d+ n·d2).

Sentences were encoded using byte-pair encoding [ 3], which has a shared source-\\ntarget vocabulary of about 37000 tokens. For English-French, we used the signiﬁcantly larger WMT\\n2014 English-French dataset consisting of 36M sentences and split tokens into a 32000 word-piece\\nvocabulary [38]. Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length. Each training\\nbatch contained a set of sentence pairs containing approximately 25000 source tokens and 25000\\ntarget tokens.\\n5.2 Hardware and Schedule\\nWe trained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. For our base models using\\nthe hyperparameters described throughout the paper, each training step took about 0.4 seconds. We\\ntrained the base models for a total of 100,000 steps or 12 hours. For our big models,(described on the\\nbottom line of table 3), step time was 1.0 seconds. The big models were trained for 300,000 steps\\n(3.5 days).\\n5.3 Optimizer\\nWe used the Adam optimizer [20] with β1 = 0.9, β2 = 0.98 and ϵ= 10−9. We varied the learning\\nrate over the course of training, according to the formula:\\nlrate= d−0.5\\nmodel ·min(step_num−0.5,step_num·warmup_steps−1.5) (3)\\nThis corresponds to increasing the learning rate linearly for the ﬁrst warmup_stepstraining steps,\\nand decreasing it thereafter proportionally to the inverse square root of the step number. We used\\nwarmup_steps= 4000.\\n5.4 Regularization\\nWe employ three types of regularization during training:\\nResidual Dropout We apply dropout [33] to the output of each sub-layer, before it is added to the\\nsub-layer input and normalized. In addition, we apply dropout to the sums of the embeddings and the\\npositional encodings in both the encoder and decoder stacks. For the base model, we use a rate of\\nPdrop = 0.1.\\n7'),\n",

Furthermore, RNN sequence-to-sequence\\nmodels have not been able to attain state-of-the-art results in small-data regimes [37].\\nWe trained a 4-layer transformer with dmodel = 1024on the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) portion of the\\nPenn Treebank [25], about 40K training sentences. We also trained it in a semi-supervised setting,\\nusing the larger high-conﬁdence and BerkleyParser corpora from with approximately 17M sentences\\n[37]. We used a vocabulary of 16K tokens for the WSJ only setting and a vocabulary of 32K tokens\\nfor the semi-supervised setting.\\nWe performed only a small number of experiments to select the dropout, both attention and residual\\n(section 5.4), learning rates and beam size on the Section 22 development set, all other parameters\\nremained unchanged from the English-to-German base translation model. During inference, we\\nincreased the maximum output length to input length + 300. We used a beam size of 21 and α= 0.3\\nfor both WSJ only and the semi-supervised setting.\\nOur results in Table 4 show that despite the lack of task-speciﬁc tuning our model performs sur-\\nprisingly well, yielding better results than all previously reported models with the exception of the\\nRecurrent Neural Network Grammar [8].\\nIn contrast to RNN sequence-to-sequence models [37], the Transformer outperforms the Berkeley-\\nParser [29] even when training only on the WSJ training set of 40K sentences.\\n7 Conclusion\\nIn this work, we presented the Transformer, the ﬁrst sequence transduction model based entirely on\\nattention, replacing the recurrent layers most commonly used in encoder-decoder architectures with\\nmulti-headed self-attention.\\nFor translation tasks, the Transformer can be trained signiﬁcantly faster than architectures based\\non recurrent or convolutional layers. On both WMT 2014 English-to-German and WMT 2014\\nEnglish-to-French translation tasks, we achieve a new state of the art. In the former task our best\\nmodel outperforms even all previously reported ensembles.\\nWe are excited about the future of attention-based models and plan to apply them to other tasks. We\\nplan to extend the Transformer to problems involving input and output modalities other than text and\\nto investigate local, restricted attention mechanisms to efﬁciently handle large inputs and outputs\\nsuch as images, audio and video. Making generation less sequential is another research goals of ours.\\nThe code we used to train and evaluate our models is available at https://github.com/\\ntensorflow/tensor2tensor.\\nAcknowledgements We are grateful to Nal Kalchbrenner and Stephan Gouws for their fruitful\\ncomments, corrections and inspiration.\\nReferences\\n[1] Jimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hinton.

Introduction\\nDeep convolutional neural networks [22, 21] have led\\nto a series of breakthroughs for image classiﬁcation [21,\\n50, 40]. Deep networks naturally integrate low/mid/high-\\nlevel features [50] and classiﬁers in an end-to-end multi-\\nlayer fashion, and the “levels” of features can be enriched\\nby the number of stacked layers (depth). Recent evidence\\n[41, 44] reveals that network depth is of crucial importance,\\nand the leading results [41, 44, 13, 16] on the challenging\\nImageNet dataset [36] all exploit “very deep” [41] models,\\nwith a depth of sixteen [41] to thirty [16]. Many other non-\\ntrivial visual recognition tasks [8, 12, 7, 32, 27] have also\\n1http://image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/2015/ and\\nhttp://mscoco.org/dataset/#detections-challenge2015.\\n0 1 2 3 4 5 60 \\n10\\n20\\niter.

Similar phenomena\\non ImageNet is presented in Fig. 4.\\ngreatly beneﬁted from very deep models.\\nDriven by the signiﬁcance of depth, a question arises: Is\\nlearning better networks as easy as stacking more layers?\\nAn obstacle to answering this question was the notorious\\nproblem of vanishing/exploding gradients [1, 9], which\\nhamper convergence from the beginning. This problem,\\nhowever, has been largely addressed by normalized initial-\\nization [23, 9, 37, 13] and intermediate normalization layers\\n[16], which enable networks with tens of layers to start con-\\nverging for stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with back-\\npropagation [22].\\nWhen deeper networks are able to start converging, a\\ndegradation problem has been exposed: with the network\\ndepth increasing, accuracy gets saturated (which might be\\nunsurprising) and then degrades rapidly. Unexpectedly,\\nsuch degradation is not caused by overﬁtting , and adding\\nmore layers to a suitably deep model leads to higher train-\\ning error, as reported in [11, 42] and thoroughly veriﬁed by\\nour experiments. Fig. 1 shows a typical example.\\nThe degradation (of training accuracy) indicates that not\\nall systems are similarly easy to optimize. Let us consider a\\nshallower architecture and its deeper counterpart that adds\\nmore layers onto it. There exists a solution by construction\\nto the deeper model: the added layers are identity mapping,\\nand the other layers are copied from the learned shallower\\nmodel. The existence of this constructed solution indicates\\nthat a deeper model should produce no higher training error\\nthan its shallower counterpart. But experiments show that\\nour current solvers on hand are unable to ﬁnd solutions that\\n1\\narXiv:1512.03385v1  [cs.CV]  10 Dec 2015'),\n",

Residual learning: a building block.\\nare comparably good or better than the constructed solution\\n(or unable to do so in feasible time).\\nIn this paper, we address the degradation problem by\\nintroducing a deep residual learning framework. In-\\nstead of hoping each few stacked layers directly ﬁt a\\ndesired underlying mapping, we explicitly let these lay-\\ners ﬁt a residual mapping. Formally, denoting the desired\\nunderlying mapping as H(x), we let the stacked nonlinear\\nlayers ﬁt another mapping of F(x) :=H(x) −x. The orig-\\ninal mapping is recast intoF(x)+ x. We hypothesize that it\\nis easier to optimize the residual mapping than to optimize\\nthe original, unreferenced mapping. To the extreme, if an\\nidentity mapping were optimal, it would be easier to push\\nthe residual to zero than to ﬁt an identity mapping by a stack\\nof nonlinear layers.\\nThe formulation of F(x) +x can be realized by feedfor-\\nward neural networks with “shortcut connections” (Fig. 2).\\nShortcut connections [2, 34, 49] are those skipping one or\\nmore layers. In our case, the shortcut connections simply\\nperform identity mapping, and their outputs are added to\\nthe outputs of the stacked layers (Fig. 2). Identity short-\\ncut connections add neither extra parameter nor computa-\\ntional complexity. The entire network can still be trained\\nend-to-end by SGD with backpropagation, and can be eas-\\nily implemented using common libraries ( e.g., Caffe [19])\\nwithout modifying the solvers.\\nWe present comprehensive experiments on ImageNet\\n[36] to show the degradation problem and evaluate our\\nmethod. We show that: 1) Our extremely deep residual nets\\nare easy to optimize, but the counterpart “plain” nets (that\\nsimply stack layers) exhibit higher training error when the\\ndepth increases; 2) Our deep residual nets can easily enjoy\\naccuracy gains from greatly increased depth, producing re-\\nsults substantially better than previous networks.\\nSimilar phenomena are also shown on the CIFAR-10 set\\n[20], suggesting that the optimization difﬁculties and the\\neffects of our method are not just akin to a particular dataset.\\nWe present successfully trained models on this dataset with\\nover 100 layers, and explore models with over 1000 layers.\\nOn the ImageNet classiﬁcation dataset [36], we obtain\\nexcellent results by extremely deep residual nets. Our 152-\\nlayer residual net is the deepest network ever presented on\\nImageNet, while still having lower complexity than VGG\\nnets [41]. Our ensemble has 3.57% top-5 error on the\\nImageNet test set, and won the 1st place in the ILSVRC\\n2015 classiﬁcation competition . The extremely deep rep-\\nresentations also have excellent generalization performance\\non other recognition tasks, and lead us to further win the\\n1st places on: ImageNet detection, ImageNet localization,\\nCOCO detection, and COCO segmentation in ILSVRC &\\nCOCO 2015 competitions. This strong evidence shows that\\nthe residual learning principle is generic, and we expect that\\nit is applicable in other vision and non-vision problems.\\n2. Related Work\\nResidual Representations. In image recognition, VLAD\\n[18] is a representation that encodes by the residual vectors\\nwith respect to a dictionary, and Fisher Vector [30] can be\\nformulated as a probabilistic version [18] of VLAD. Both\\nof them are powerful shallow representations for image re-\\ntrieval and classiﬁcation [4, 48]. For vector quantization,\\nencoding residual vectors [17] is shown to be more effec-\\ntive than encoding original vectors.\\nIn low-level vision and computer graphics, for solv-\\ning Partial Differential Equations (PDEs), the widely used\\nMultigrid method [3] reformulates the system as subprob-\\nlems at multiple scales, where each subproblem is respon-\\nsible for the residual solution between a coarser and a ﬁner\\nscale. An alternative to Multigrid is hierarchical basis pre-\\nconditioning [45, 46], which relies on variables that repre-\\nsent residual vectors between two scales. It has been shown\\n[3, 45, 46] that these solvers converge much faster than stan-\\ndard solvers that are unaware of the residual nature of the\\nsolutions. These methods suggest that a good reformulation\\nor preconditioning can simplify the optimization.\\nShortcut Connections. Practices and theories that lead to\\nshortcut connections [2, 34, 49] have been studied for a long\\ntime. An early practice of training multi-layer perceptrons\\n(MLPs) is to add a linear layer connected from the network\\ninput to the output [34, 49]. In [44, 24], a few interme-\\ndiate layers are directly connected to auxiliary classiﬁers\\nfor addressing vanishing/exploding gradients. The papers\\nof [39, 38, 31, 47] propose methods for centering layer re-\\nsponses, gradients, and propagated errors, implemented by\\nshortcut connections. In [44], an “inception” layer is com-\\nposed of a shortcut branch and a few deeper branches.\\nConcurrent with our work, “highway networks” [42, 43]\\npresent shortcut connections with gating functions [15].\\nThese gates are data-dependent and have parameters, in\\ncontrast to our identity shortcuts that are parameter-free.\\nWhen a gated shortcut is “closed” (approaching zero), the\\nlayers in highway networks represent non-residual func-\\ntions. On the contrary, our formulation always learns\\nresidual functions; our identity shortcuts are never closed,\\nand all information is always passed through, with addi-\\ntional residual functions to be learned.

Deep Residual Learning\\n3.1. Residual Learning\\nLet us consider H(x) as an underlying mapping to be\\nﬁt by a few stacked layers (not necessarily the entire net),\\nwith x denoting the inputs to the ﬁrst of these layers. If one\\nhypothesizes that multiple nonlinear layers can asymptoti-\\ncally approximate complicated functions2, then it is equiv-\\nalent to hypothesize that they can asymptotically approxi-\\nmate the residual functions, i.e., H(x) −x (assuming that\\nthe input and output are of the same dimensions). So\\nrather than expect stacked layers to approximate H(x), we\\nexplicitly let these layers approximate a residual function\\nF(x) := H(x) −x. The original function thus becomes\\nF(x)+ x. Although both forms should be able to asymptot-\\nically approximate the desired functions (as hypothesized),\\nthe ease of learning might be different.\\nThis reformulation is motivated by the counterintuitive\\nphenomena about the degradation problem (Fig. 1, left). As\\nwe discussed in the introduction, if the added layers can\\nbe constructed as identity mappings, a deeper model should\\nhave training error no greater than its shallower counter-\\npart. The degradation problem suggests that the solvers\\nmight have difﬁculties in approximating identity mappings\\nby multiple nonlinear layers. With the residual learning re-\\nformulation, if identity mappings are optimal, the solvers\\nmay simply drive the weights of the multiple nonlinear lay-\\ners toward zero to approach identity mappings.\\nIn real cases, it is unlikely that identity mappings are op-\\ntimal, but our reformulation may help to precondition the\\nproblem. If the optimal function is closer to an identity\\nmapping than to a zero mapping, it should be easier for the\\nsolver to ﬁnd the perturbations with reference to an identity\\nmapping, than to learn the function as a new one. We show\\nby experiments (Fig. 7) that the learned residual functions in\\ngeneral have small responses, suggesting that identity map-\\npings provide reasonable preconditioning.\\n3.2. Identity Mapping by Shortcuts\\nWe adopt residual learning to every few stacked layers.\\nA building block is shown in Fig. 2. Formally, in this paper\\nwe consider a building block deﬁned as:\\ny = F(x,{Wi}) +x. (1)\\nHere x and y are the input and output vectors of the lay-\\ners considered. The function F(x,{Wi}) represents the\\nresidual mapping to be learned. For the example in Fig. 2\\nthat has two layers, F = W2σ(W1x) in which σ denotes\\n2This hypothesis, however, is still an open question. See [28].\\nReLU [29] and the biases are omitted for simplifying no-\\ntations. The operation F+ x is performed by a shortcut\\nconnection and element-wise addition. We adopt the sec-\\nond nonlinearity after the addition (i.e., σ(y), see Fig. 2).\\nThe shortcut connections in Eqn.(1) introduce neither ex-\\ntra parameter nor computation complexity. This is not only\\nattractive in practice but also important in our comparisons\\nbetween plain and residual networks. We can fairly com-\\npare plain/residual networks that simultaneously have the\\nsame number of parameters, depth, width, and computa-\\ntional cost (except for the negligible element-wise addition).\\nThe dimensions of x and Fmust be equal in Eqn.(1).\\nIf this is not the case ( e.g., when changing the input/output\\nchannels), we can perform a linear projection Ws by the\\nshortcut connections to match the dimensions:\\ny = F(x,{Wi}) +Wsx. (2)\\nWe can also use a square matrixWs in Eqn.(1). But we will\\nshow by experiments that the identity mapping is sufﬁcient\\nfor addressing the degradation problem and is economical,\\nand thus Ws is only used when matching dimensions.\\nThe form of the residual function Fis ﬂexible. Exper-\\niments in this paper involve a function Fthat has two or\\nthree layers (Fig. 5), while more layers are possible. But if\\nFhas only a single layer, Eqn.(1) is similar to a linear layer:\\ny = W1x + x, for which we have not observed advantages.\\nWe also note that although the above notations are about\\nfully-connected layers for simplicity, they are applicable to\\nconvolutional layers. The function F(x,{Wi}) can repre-\\nsent multiple convolutional layers. The element-wise addi-\\ntion is performed on two feature maps, channel by channel.\\n3.3. Network Architectures\\nWe have tested various plain/residual nets, and have ob-\\nserved consistent phenomena. To provide instances for dis-\\ncussion, we describe two models for ImageNet as follows.\\nPlain Network. Our plain baselines (Fig. 3, middle) are\\nmainly inspired by the philosophy of VGG nets [41] (Fig. 3,\\nleft). The convolutional layers mostly have 3 ×3 ﬁlters and\\nfollow two simple design rules: (i) for the same output\\nfeature map size, the layers have the same number of ﬁl-\\nters; and (ii) if the feature map size is halved, the num-\\nber of ﬁlters is doubled so as to preserve the time com-\\nplexity per layer. We perform downsampling directly by\\nconvolutional layers that have a stride of 2. The network\\nends with a global average pooling layer and a 1000-way\\nfully-connected layer with softmax. The total number of\\nweighted layers is 34 in Fig. 3 (middle).\\nIt is worth noticing that our model has fewer ﬁlters and\\nlower complexity than VGG nets [41] (Fig. 3, left). Our 34-\\nlayer baseline has 3.6 billion FLOPs (multiply-adds), which\\nis only 18% of VGG-19 (19.6 billion FLOPs).\\n3'),\n",

Based on the above plain network, we\\ninsert shortcut connections (Fig. 3, right) which turn the\\nnetwork into its counterpart residual version. The identity\\nshortcuts (Eqn.(1)) can be directly used when the input and\\noutput are of the same dimensions (solid line shortcuts in\\nFig. 3). When the dimensions increase (dotted line shortcuts\\nin Fig. 3), we consider two options: (A) The shortcut still\\nperforms identity mapping, with extra zero entries padded\\nfor increasing dimensions. This option introduces no extra\\nparameter; (B) The projection shortcut in Eqn.(2) is used to\\nmatch dimensions (done by 1 ×1 convolutions). For both\\noptions, when the shortcuts go across feature maps of two\\nsizes, they are performed with a stride of 2.\\n3.4. Implementation\\nOur implementation for ImageNet follows the practice\\nin [21, 41]. The image is resized with its shorter side ran-\\ndomly sampled in [256,480] for scale augmentation [41].\\nA 224×224 crop is randomly sampled from an image or its\\nhorizontal ﬂip, with the per-pixel mean subtracted [21]. The\\nstandard color augmentation in [21] is used. We adopt batch\\nnormalization (BN) [16] right after each convolution and\\nbefore activation, following [16]. We initialize the weights\\nas in [13] and train all plain/residual nets from scratch. We\\nuse SGD with a mini-batch size of 256. The learning rate\\nstarts from 0.1 and is divided by 10 when the error plateaus,\\nand the models are trained for up to60 ×104 iterations. We\\nuse a weight decay of 0.0001 and a momentum of 0.9. We\\ndo not use dropout [14], following the practice in [16].\\nIn testing, for comparison studies we adopt the standard\\n10-crop testing [21]. For best results, we adopt the fully-\\nconvolutional form as in [41, 13], and average the scores\\nat multiple scales (images are resized such that the shorter\\nside is in {224,256,384,480,640}).\\n4. Experiments\\n4.1. ImageNet Classiﬁcation\\nWe evaluate our method on the ImageNet 2012 classiﬁ-\\ncation dataset [36] that consists of 1000 classes. The models\\nare trained on the 1.28 million training images, and evalu-\\nated on the 50k validation images.

In Table 3 we\\ncompare three options: (A) zero-padding shortcuts are used\\nfor increasing dimensions, and all shortcuts are parameter-\\nfree (the same as Table 2 and Fig. 4 right); (B) projec-\\ntion shortcuts are used for increasing dimensions, and other\\nshortcuts are identity; and (C) all shortcuts are projections.\\nTable 3 shows that all three options are considerably bet-\\nter than the plain counterpart. B is slightly better than A. We\\nargue that this is because the zero-padded dimensions in A\\nindeed have no residual learning. C is marginally better than\\nB, and we attribute this to the extra parameters introduced\\nby many (thirteen) projection shortcuts. But the small dif-\\nferences among A/B/C indicate that projection shortcuts are\\nnot essential for addressing the degradation problem. So we\\ndo not use option C in the rest of this paper, to reduce mem-\\nory/time complexity and model sizes. Identity shortcuts are\\nparticularly important for not increasing the complexity of\\nthe bottleneck architectures that are introduced below.\\nDeeper Bottleneck Architectures. Next we describe our\\ndeeper nets for ImageNet. Because of concerns on the train-\\ning time that we can afford, we modify the building block\\nas a bottleneck design4. For each residual function F, we\\nuse a stack of 3 layers instead of 2 (Fig. 5). The three layers\\nare 1×1, 3×3, and 1×1 convolutions, where the 1×1 layers\\nare responsible for reducing and then increasing (restoring)\\ndimensions, leaving the 3×3 layer a bottleneck with smaller\\ninput/output dimensions. Fig. 5 shows an example, where\\nboth designs have similar time complexity.\\nThe parameter-free identity shortcuts are particularly im-\\nportant for the bottleneck architectures. If the identity short-\\ncut in Fig. 5 (right) is replaced with projection, one can\\nshow that the time complexity and model size are doubled,\\nas the shortcut is connected to the two high-dimensional\\nends. So identity shortcuts lead to more efﬁcient models\\nfor the bottleneck designs.\\n50-layer ResNet: We replace each 2-layer block in the\\n4Deeper non-bottleneck ResNets ( e.g., Fig. 5 left) also gain accuracy\\nfrom increased depth (as shown on CIFAR-10), but are not as economical\\nas the bottleneck ResNets. So the usage of bottleneck designs is mainly due\\nto practical considerations. We further note that the degradation problem\\nof plain nets is also witnessed for the bottleneck designs.\\n6'),\n",

Our focus\\nis on the behaviors of extremely deep networks, but not on\\npushing the state-of-the-art results, so we intentionally use\\nsimple architectures as follows.\\nThe plain/residual architectures follow the form in Fig. 3\\n(middle/right). The network inputs are 32×32 images, with\\nthe per-pixel mean subtracted. The ﬁrst layer is 3×3 convo-\\nlutions. Then we use a stack of 6nlayers with 3×3 convo-\\nlutions on the feature maps of sizes{32,16,8}respectively,\\nwith 2nlayers for each feature map size. The numbers of\\nﬁlters are {16,32,64}respectively. The subsampling is per-\\nformed by convolutions with a stride of 2.

Object Detection Baselines\\nIn this section we introduce our detection method based\\non the baseline Faster R-CNN [32] system. The models are\\ninitialized by the ImageNet classiﬁcation models, and then\\nﬁne-tuned on the object detection data. We have experi-\\nmented with ResNet-50/101 at the time of the ILSVRC &\\nCOCO 2015 detection competitions.\\nUnlike VGG-16 used in [32], our ResNet has no hidden\\nfc layers. We adopt the idea of “Networks on Conv fea-\\nture maps” (NoC) [33] to address this issue. We compute\\nthe full-image shared conv feature maps using those lay-\\ners whose strides on the image are no greater than 16 pixels\\n(i.e., conv1, conv2 x, conv3 x, and conv4 x, totally 91 conv\\nlayers in ResNet-101; Table 1). We consider these layers as\\nanalogous to the 13 conv layers in VGG-16, and by doing\\nso, both ResNet and VGG-16 have conv feature maps of the\\nsame total stride (16 pixels). These layers are shared by a\\nregion proposal network (RPN, generating 300 proposals)\\n[32] and a Fast R-CNN detection network [7]. RoI pool-\\ning [7] is performed before conv5 1. On this RoI-pooled\\nfeature, all layers of conv5 x and up are adopted for each\\nregion, playing the roles of VGG-16’s fc layers. The ﬁnal\\nclassiﬁcation layer is replaced by two sibling layers (classi-\\nﬁcation and box regression [7]).\\nFor the usage of BN layers, after pre-training, we com-\\npute the BN statistics (means and variances) for each layer\\non the ImageNet training set. Then the BN layers are ﬁxed\\nduring ﬁne-tuning for object detection. As such, the BN\\nlayers become linear activations with constant offsets and\\nscales, and BN statistics are not updated by ﬁne-tuning. We\\nﬁx the BN layers mainly for reducing memory consumption\\nin Faster R-CNN training.\\nPASCAL VOC\\nFollowing [7, 32], for the PASCAL VOC 2007 test set,\\nwe use the 5k trainval images in VOC 2007 and 16k train-\\nval images in VOC 2012 for training (“07+12”). For the\\nPASCAL VOC 2012 test set, we use the 10k trainval+test\\nimages in VOC 2007 and 16ktrainval images in VOC 2012\\nfor training (“07++12”). The hyper-parameters for train-\\ning Faster R-CNN are the same as in [32]. Table 7 shows\\nthe results. ResNet-101 improves the mAP by >3% over\\nVGG-16. This gain is solely because of the improved fea-\\ntures learned by ResNet.\\nMS COCO\\nThe MS COCO dataset [26] involves 80 object cate-\\ngories. We evaluate the PASCAL VOC metric (mAP @\\nIoU = 0.5) and the standard COCO metric (mAP @ IoU =\\n.5:.05:.95). We use the 80k images on the train set for train-\\ning and the 40k images on the val set for evaluation. Our\\ndetection system for COCO is similar to that for PASCAL\\nVOC. We train the COCO models with an 8-GPU imple-\\nmentation, and thus the RPN step has a mini-batch size of\\n8 images (i.e., 1 per GPU) and the Fast R-CNN step has a\\nmini-batch size of 16 images. The RPN step and Fast R-\\nCNN step are both trained for 240k iterations with a learn-\\ning rate of 0.001 and then for 80k iterations with 0.0001.\\nTable 8 shows the results on the MS COCO validation\\nset. ResNet-101 has a 6% increase of mAP@[.5, .95] over\\nVGG-16, which is a 28% relative improvement, solely con-\\ntributed by the features learned by the better network. Re-\\nmarkably, the mAP@[.5, .95]’s absolute increase (6.0%) is\\nnearly as big as mAP@.5’s (6.9%). This suggests that a\\ndeeper network can improve both recognition and localiza-\\ntion.\\nB. Object Detection Improvements\\nFor completeness, we report the improvements made for\\nthe competitions. These improvements are based on deep\\nfeatures and thus should beneﬁt from residual learning.\\nMS COCO\\nBox reﬁnement. Our box reﬁnement partially follows the it-\\nerative localization in [6]. In Faster R-CNN, the ﬁnal output\\nis a regressed box that is different from its proposal box. So\\nfor inference, we pool a new feature from the regressed box\\nand obtain a new classiﬁcation score and a new regressed\\nbox. We combine these 300 new predictions with the orig-\\ninal 300 predictions. Non-maximum suppression (NMS) is\\napplied on the union set of predicted boxes using an IoU\\nthreshold of 0.3 [8], followed by box voting [6]. Box re-\\nﬁnement improves mAP by about 2 points (Table 9).\\nGlobal context. We combine global context in the Fast\\nR-CNN step. Given the full-image conv feature map, we\\npool a feature by global Spatial Pyramid Pooling [12] (with\\na “single-level” pyramid) which can be implemented as\\n“RoI” pooling using the entire image’s bounding box as the\\nRoI. This pooled feature is fed into the post-RoI layers to\\nobtain a global context feature. This global feature is con-\\ncatenated with the original per-region feature, followed by\\nthe sibling classiﬁcation and box regression layers. This\\nnew structure is trained end-to-end. Global context im-\\nproves mAP@.5 by about 1 point (Table 9).\\nMulti-scale testing. In the above, all results are obtained by\\nsingle-scale training/testing as in [32], where the image’s\\nshorter side is s = 600pixels. Multi-scale training/testing\\nhas been developed in [12, 7] by selecting a scale from a\\nfeature pyramid, and in [33] by using maxout layers. In\\nour current implementation, we have performed multi-scale\\ntesting following [33]; we have not performed multi-scale\\ntraining because of limited time. In addition, we have per-\\nformed multi-scale testing only for the Fast R-CNN step\\n(but not yet for the RPN step). With a trained model, we\\ncompute conv feature maps on an image pyramid, where the\\nimage’s shorter sides are s ∈ {200,400,600,800,1000}.\\n10'),\n",

ImageNet Localization\\nThe ImageNet Localization (LOC) task [36] requires to\\nclassify and localize the objects. Following [40, 41], we\\nassume that the image-level classiﬁers are ﬁrst adopted for\\npredicting the class labels of an image, and the localiza-\\ntion algorithm only accounts for predicting bounding boxes\\nbased on the predicted classes. We adopt the “per-class re-\\ngression” (PCR) strategy [40, 41], learning a bounding box\\nregressor for each class. We pre-train the networks for Im-\\nageNet classiﬁcation and then ﬁne-tune them for localiza-\\ntion. We train networks on the provided 1000-class Ima-\\ngeNet training set.\\nOur localization algorithm is based on the RPN frame-\\nwork of [32] with a few modiﬁcations. Unlike the way in\\n[32] that is category-agnostic, our RPN for localization is\\ndesigned in a per-class form. This RPN ends with two sib-\\nling 1×1 convolutional layers for binary classiﬁcation (cls)\\nand box regression (reg), as in [32]. The cls and reg layers\\nare both in a per-class from, in contrast to [32]. Speciﬁ-\\ncally, the cls layer has a 1000-d output, and each dimension\\nis binary logistic regression for predicting being or not be-\\ning an object class; the reg layer has a 1000 ×4-d output\\nconsisting of box regressors for 1000 classes. As in [32],\\nour bounding box regression is with reference to multiple\\ntranslation-invariant “anchor” boxes at each position.\\nAs in our ImageNet classiﬁcation training (Sec. 3.4), we\\nrandomly sample 224 ×224 crops for data augmentation.\\nWe use a mini-batch size of 256 images for ﬁne-tuning. To\\navoid negative samples being dominate, 8 anchors are ran-\\ndomly sampled for each image, where the sampled positive\\nand negative anchors have a ratio of 1:1 [32]. For testing,\\nthe network is applied on the image fully-convolutionally.\\nTable 13 compares the localization results. Following\\n[41], we ﬁrst perform “oracle” testing using the ground truth\\nclass as the classiﬁcation prediction.

Under the same setting, our RPN method us-\\ning ResNet-101 net signiﬁcantly reduces the center-crop er-\\nror to 13.3%. This comparison demonstrates the excellent\\nperformance of our framework. With dense (fully convolu-\\ntional) and multi-scale testing, our ResNet-101 has an error\\nof 11.7% using ground truth classes. Using ResNet-101 for\\npredicting classes (4.6% top-5 classiﬁcation error, Table 4),\\nthe top-5 localization error is 14.4%.\\nThe above results are only based on theproposal network\\n(RPN) in Faster R-CNN [32]. One may use the detection\\nnetwork (Fast R-CNN [7]) in Faster R-CNN to improve the\\nresults. But we notice that on this dataset, one image usually\\ncontains a single dominate object, and the proposal regions\\nhighly overlap with each other and thus have very similar\\nRoI-pooled features. As a result, the image-centric training\\nof Fast R-CNN [7] generates samples of small variations,\\nwhich may not be desired for stochastic training. Motivated\\nby this, in our current experiment we use the original R-\\nCNN [8] that is RoI-centric, in place of Fast R-CNN.\\nOur R-CNN implementation is as follows. We apply the\\nper-class RPN trained as above on the training images to\\npredict bounding boxes for the ground truth class. These\\npredicted boxes play a role of class-dependent proposals.\\nFor each training image, the highest scored 200 proposals\\nare extracted as training samples to train an R-CNN classi-\\nﬁer. The image region is cropped from a proposal, warped\\nto 224×224 pixels, and fed into the classiﬁcation network\\nas in R-CNN [8]. The outputs of this network consist of two\\nsibling fc layers for cls and reg, also in a per-class form.\\nThis R-CNN network is ﬁne-tuned on the training set us-\\ning a mini-batch size of 256 in the RoI-centric fashion. For\\ntesting, the RPN generates the highest scored 200 proposals\\nfor each predicted class, and the R-CNN network is used to\\nupdate these proposals’ scores and box positions.\\nThis method reduces the top-5 localization error to\\n10.6% (Table 13). This is our single-model result on the\\nvalidation set. Using an ensemble of networks for both clas-\\nsiﬁcation and localization, we achieve a top-5 localization\\nerror of 9.0% on the test set. This number signiﬁcantly out-\\nperforms the ILSVRC 14 results (Table 14), showing a 64%\\nrelative reduction of error. This result won the 1st place in\\nthe ImageNet localization task in ILSVRC 2015.\\n12'),\n",

We\\nclip gradient norms at 1.0, except for some mid-\\nﬂight changes that reduce this threshold down\\nfrom 1.0 to 0.3 (see Section 2.5). We also in-\\nclude a gradient predivide factor to reduce the risk\\nof over/underﬂows when computing the gradient\\nacross all ranks (splitting the division by the world\\nsize of N into two division operations by\\n√\\nN).\\n2.3 Pre-training Corpus\\nThe pre-training corpus contains a concatenation\\nof datasets used in RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019b),\\nthe Pile (Gao et al., 2021a), and PushShift.io Red-\\ndit (Baumgartner et al., 2020; Roller et al., 2021).\\nAll corpora were previously collected or ﬁltered\\nto contain predominantly English text, but a small\\namount of non-English data is still present within\\nthe corpus via CommonCrawl.\\nWe removed duplicated documents across all\\ndatasets by ﬁltering out documents via Min-\\nhashLSH (Rajaraman and Ullman, 2011) with a\\nJaccard similarity ≥.95. We found the Pile was\\nparticularly full of duplicate documents, and ad-\\nvise future researchers using the Pile to perform\\nadditional de-duplication processing.\\nWe tokenize all corpora using the GPT-2 byte\\nlevel BPE tokenizer (Sennrich et al., 2016; Radford\\net al., 2019; Brown et al., 2020). Our ﬁnal corpus\\ncontains roughly 180B tokens.\\nRoBERTa We included the BookCorpus (Zhu\\net al., 2015) and Stories (Trinh and Le, 2018) sub-\\nsets of the RoBERTa corpus and utilized an up-\\ndated version of CCNews, containing news stories\\ncrawled through September 28, 2021. This CC-\\nNews v2 corpus was preprocessed the same way as\\nthe original RoBERTa CCNews (Liu et al., 2019b).\\nThe Pile We included a subset of the Pile\\n(Gao et al., 2021a), including: CommonCrawl,'),\n",

We achieve utilization of up\\nto 147 TFLOP/s per GPU. We keep Adam state in\\nFP32, since we shard it across all hosts, while the\\nmodel weights remained in FP16. To avoid under-\\nﬂows, we used dynamic loss scaling, as described\\nin Micikevicius et al. (2017).\\n2.5 Training Processes\\nHere we describe signiﬁcant training process ad-\\njustments that arose during OPT-175B pre-training.\\nHardware Failures We faced a signiﬁcant num-\\nber of hardware failures in our compute cluster\\nwhile training OPT-175B. In total, hardware fail-\\nures contributed to at least 35 manual restarts and\\nthe cycling of over 100 hosts over the course of 2\\nmonths. During manual restarts, the training run\\nwas paused, and a series of diagnostics tests were\\nconducted to detect problematic nodes. Flagged\\nnodes were then cordoned off and training was re-\\nsumed from the last saved checkpoint. Given the\\ndifference between the number of hosts cycled out\\nand the number of manual restarts, we estimate 70+\\nautomatic restarts due to hardware failures.\\nLoss Divergences Loss divergences were also an\\nissue in our training run. When the loss diverged,\\nwe found that lowering the learning rate and restart-\\ning from an earlier checkpoint allowed for the job\\nto recover and continue training. We noticed a cor-\\nrelation between loss divergence, our dynamic loss\\n0k 20k 40k 60k 80k 100k 120k 140k\\nIterations\\n0.0e-4\\n0.2e-4\\n0.4e-4\\n0.6e-4\\n0.8e-4\\n1.0e-4\\n1.2e-4Learning Rate\\nEmpirical Learning Rate\\nFigure 1: Empirical LR schedule.

Early\\nin training, we also noticed that lowering gradient\\nclipping from 1.0 to 0.3 helped with stability; see\\nour released logbook for exact details. Figure 2\\nshows our validation loss with respect to training\\niterations.\\nOther Mid-ﬂight Changes We conducted a\\nnumber of other experimental mid-ﬂight changes\\nto handle loss divergences. These included: switch-\\ning to vanilla SGD (optimization plateaued quickly,\\nand we reverted back to AdamW); resetting the dy-\\nnamic loss scalar (this helped recover some but not\\nall divergences); and switching to a newer version\\nof Megatron (this reduced pressure on activation\\nnorms and improved throughput).'),\n",

Some of the remaining datasets show\\ninconsistent performance with respect to model\\nsize for both OPT and GPT-3 models (BoolQ, CB,\\nWSC, RTE).

Similar to our zero-shot evaluation, we\\nhypothesize our one- and few-shot evaluation setup\\nmay differ signiﬁcantly from Brown et al. (2020).\\n3.2 Dialogue\\nGiven that LLMs are known to be an integral com-\\nponent of modern dialogue models (Adiwardana\\net al., 2020; Roller et al., 2021; Thoppilan et al.,\\n2022; Rae et al., 2021; Chowdhery et al., 2022), we\\nadditionally evaluate OPT-175B on several open\\nsource dialogue datasets. In particular, we fol-\\nlow Roller et al. (2021), and evaluate on ConvAI2\\n(Dinan et al., 2020b), Wizard of Wikipedia (Di-\\nnan et al., 2019b), Empathetic Dialogues (Rashkin\\net al., 2019), and Blended Skill Talk (Smith et al.,\\n2020). We additionally evaluate on the more recent\\nWizard of Internet dataset (Komeili et al., 2021).\\nWe focus our comparisons primarily against ex-\\nisting open source dialogue models including the\\nﬁne-tuned BlenderBot 1 (Roller et al., 2021) and\\nits pre-training counterpart Reddit 2.7B. We also\\ncompare against the ﬁne-tuned R2C2 BlenderBot,\\na 2.7B parameter BlenderBot-like model trained by\\nShuster et al. (2022).\\nWe report Perplexity and Unigram F1 (UF1)\\noverlap, following the metrics of the ConvAI2 com-\\npetition (Dinan et al., 2020b). To control for dif-\\nferent tokenization in each of the models, we nor-\\nmalize all perplexities to be in the space of the\\nGPT-2 tokenizer (Radford et al., 2019). We also\\nnote which models are supervised with respect to\\nthese dialogue tasks and which are unsupervised.\\nFor OPT-175B, all generations are performed using\\ngreedy decoding up to a maximum of 32 tokens.\\nWe do not attempt to prompt the model at all except\\nfor alternating “Person 1:” and “Person 2:” lines of\\ndialogue. The remaining models use the generation\\nparameters found in BlenderBot 1.\\nResults are shown in Table 2. We see that\\nOPT-175B signiﬁcantly outperforms the also-\\nunsupervised Reddit 2.7B model on all tasks, and\\nperforms competitively with the fully supervised\\nBlenderBot 1 model, especially in the ConvAI2\\ndataset. On the Wizard-of-Internet dataset, which\\nis fully unsupervised for all models, we see that\\nOPT-175B obtains the lowest perplexity but still\\nhas lower UF1 than the models with Wizard-of-\\nWikipedia supervision.\\nWe were somewhat surprised that the evaluations\\nof the unsupervised OPT-175B model were as com-\\npetitive as BlenderBot 1 on the ConvAI2 dataset.\\nThis may indicate leakage of the ConvAI2 dataset\\ninto the general pre-training corpus or even into the\\nvalidation data as evaluated in Table 2. To address\\nconcerns of leakage, we searched our pre-training\\ncorpus for the ﬁrst conversation in the ConvAI2\\ndataset, but we did not ﬁnd any overlap. We addi-\\ntionally evaluated OPT-175B on the ConvAI2 hid-\\nden test set, which has never been publicly released,\\nand achieved 10.7 ppl and .185 UF1, matching the\\nperformance of the validation set. Furthermore, we\\nevaluated OPT-175B on a subset of the ConvAI2-\\nlike MultiSessionChat (MSC) dataset (Xu et al.,\\n2021b) and obtained a perplexity of 9.7 and UF1\\nof .177, indicating the model is generalizing well\\nacross multiple PersonaChat-like datasets. Since\\nboth MSC and WoI datasets were releasedafter the\\nCommonCrawl snapshot used in pre-training cor-\\npus, there is minimal risk of leakage. We conclude\\nthat OPT-175B has a strong ability to maintain a\\nconsistent persona across conversations, a behav-\\nior also highlighted in LaMDA (Thoppilan et al.,\\n2022).\\n4 Bias & Toxicity Evaluations\\nTo understand the potential harm of OPT-175B,\\nwe evaluate a series of benchmarks related to hate\\nspeech detection, stereotype awareness, and toxic\\ncontent generation. While there may be shortcom-\\nings in these benchmarks (Blodgett et al., 2021; Ja-\\ncobs and Wallach, 2021), these measurements pro-\\nvide a ﬁrst step towards understanding the limita-\\ntions of OPT-175B. We compare primarily against\\nGPT-3 Davinci, as these benchmarks were not yet\\navailable to be included in Brown et al. (2020).\\n4.1 Hate Speech Detection\\nUsing the ETHOS dataset provided in Mollas et al.\\n(2020) and instrumented by Chiu and Alexander\\n(2021), we measure the ability of OPT-175B to\\nidentify whether or not certain English statements\\nare racist or sexist (or neither).

(2020) showed that Pushshift.io Red-\\ndit corpus has a higher incidence rate for stereo-\\ntypes and discriminatory text than other corpora\\n(e.g. Wikipedia).

(2021) and Artetxe et al.\\n(2021), we use StereoSet (Nadeem et al., 2021)\\nto measure stereotypical bias across 4 categories:\\nprofession, gender, religion, and race.

We also observe that all\\n3 models have increased likelihood of generating\\ntoxic continuations as the toxicity of the prompt\\nincreases, which is consistent with the observations\\nof Chowdhery et al. (2022). As with our exper-\\niments in hate speech detection, we suspect the\\ninclusion of unmoderated social media texts in the\\npre-training corpus raises model familiarity with,\\nand therefore propensity to generate and detect,\\ntoxic text. This strong awareness of toxic language\\nmay or may not be desirable depending on the\\nspeciﬁc requirements of downstream applications.\\nFuture applications of OPT-175B should consider\\nthis aspect of the model, and take additional miti-\\ngations, or avoid usage entirely as appropriate.\\n4.5 Dialogue Safety Evaluations\\nFinally, we compare OPT-175B on two Dialogue\\nSafety evaluations. The ﬁrst, SaferDialogues (Ung\\net al., 2021), measures the ability to recover from\\nexplicit safety failures, usually in the form of apol-\\nogizing or recognizing its mistake. The second, the\\nSafety Bench Unit Tests (Dinan et al., 2021), mea-\\nsures how unsafe a model’s response is, stratiﬁed\\nacross 4 levels of topic sensitivity: Safe, Realis-\\ntic, Unsafe, and Adversarial.

OPT-\\n175B is roughly on par with the Reddit 2.7B model, but\\nperforms worse in the Unsafe setting.\\nand Xu et al. (2020), we ﬁnd that the models ﬁne-\\ntuned on curated dialogue datasets (BlenderBot 1,\\nR2C2) have overall lower toxicity. We conclude\\nthat future experimentation of OPT-175B for dia-\\nlogue should contain explicit ﬁne-tuning on curated\\ndatasets in order to improve the safety proﬁle.\\n5 Limitations\\nIn Sections 3.1 and 4, we carried out extensive\\nevaluation of all released models at varying scales.\\nWe saw parity in performance for standard evalu-\\nation datasets used in the GPT-3 models. More-\\nover, we performed safety, bias, and inclusion eval-\\nuations, again seeing largely comparable perfor-\\nmance with some variations in toxicity and hate\\nspeech detection. However, such evaluations may\\nnot fully characterize the complete limitations of\\nthese models. In general, we qualitatively observe\\nthat OPT-175B suffers from the same limitations\\nnoted in other LLMs (Brown et al., 2020; Lieber\\net al., 2021; Thoppilan et al., 2022; Rae et al., 2021;\\nSmith et al., 2022; Chowdhery et al., 2022).\\nIn particular, we found OPT-175B does not work\\nwell with declarative instructions or point-blank\\ninterrogatives. Prompting with such instructions\\ntends to produce a simulation of a dialogue begin-\\nning with such an instruction, rather than an execu-\\ntion of the instruction. Future work into instruction\\nlearning, in the vein of InstructGPT (Ouyang et al.,\\n2022), may alleviate these limitations.\\nOPT-175B also tends to be repetitive and can eas-\\nily get stuck in a loop. While sampling can reduce\\nthe incidence rate of repetitive behavior (Holtz-\\nman et al., 2020), we anecdotally found it did not\\neliminate it entirely when only one generation is\\nsampled. Future work may wish to incorporate\\nmore modern strategies for reducing repetition and\\nimproving diversity, such as unlikelihood training\\n(Welleck et al., 2020) or best-ﬁrst decoding (Meis-\\nter et al., 2020).\\nSimilar to other LLMs, OPT-175B can produce\\nfactually incorrect statements (Adiwardana et al.,\\n2020; Brown et al., 2020; Roller et al., 2021; Rae\\net al., 2021; Chowdhery et al., 2022; Thoppilan\\net al., 2022). This can be particularly harmful in\\napplications where information accuracy is critical,\\nsuch as healthcare and scientiﬁc discovery (Wei-\\ndinger et al., 2021b). Recently, several efforts have\\nreported that retrieval-augmented models can im-\\nprove factual correctness of LLMs (Lewis et al.,\\n2020; Komeili et al., 2021; Thoppilan et al., 2022;\\nBorgeaud et al., 2021; Shuster et al., 2022; Nakano\\net al., 2021). We believe OPT-175B will also bene-\\nﬁt from retrieval-augmentation in future iterations.\\nAs shown in Section 4, we also ﬁnd OPT-175B\\nhas a high propensity to generate toxic language\\nand reinforce harmful stereotypes, even when pro-\\nvided with a relatively innocuous prompt (Gehman\\net al., 2020), and adversarial prompts are trivial to\\nﬁnd (Dinan et al., 2021). There has been a great\\ndeal of work on mitigations for toxicity and bi-\\nases (Dathathri et al., 2019; Dinan et al., 2019a;\\nSheng et al., 2019; Dinan et al., 2020a; Liu et al.,\\n2019a; Krause et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2020; Liang\\net al., 2021; Dinan et al., 2021; Xu et al., 2021a;\\nDhamala et al., 2021; Schick et al., 2021; Ouyang\\net al., 2022). Depending on downstream applica-\\ntions, future uses of OPT-175B may need to employ\\nthese or novel mitigation approaches, especially be-\\nfore any real world deployment. Given our primary\\ngoal as a replication of GPT-3, we choose not to\\napply these mitigations in this ﬁrst release.\\nIn summary, we still believe this technology is\\npremature for commercial deployment. Despite\\nincluding data sheets and model cards, we believe\\nmore scrutiny should be afforded to the training\\ndata with additional data characterization and se-\\nlection criteria in order to use data responsibly. The\\ncurrent practice is to feed the model with as much\\ndata as possible and minimal selection within these\\ndatasets. Despite having comprehensive evalua-\\ntions, we would ideally have more streamlined and\\nconsistent evaluation setups to ensure replicability\\nand reproducibility of evaluation scenarios. Dif-\\nferences in prompting styles and number of shots\\nfor in-context learning could create variations that\\nlead to different results. We hope that the public\\nrelease of the OPT models will enable many more\\nresearchers to work on these important issues.'),\n",

These details\\nare generally omitted from previous publications,\\nlikely due to the inability to fully ablate changes\\nmade mid-ﬂight (without drastically increasing the\\ncompute budget).

There is a\\ngrowing body of work detailing ethical and social\\nrisks from deploying language models with emer-\\ngent capabilities at scale (Weidinger et al., 2021a;\\nBommasani et al., 2021; Dinan et al., 2021; Kenton\\net al., 2021). By limiting access to OPT-175B to\\nthe research community, along with releasing with\\na non-commercial license, we aim to focus devel-\\nopment efforts on quantifying the limitations of the\\nLLMs ﬁrst, before broader commercial deployment\\noccurs.\\nFurthermore, there exists signiﬁcant compute\\nand carbon cost to reproduce models of this size.\\nWhile OPT-175B was developed with an estimated\\ncarbon emissions footprint (CO2eq) of 75 tons,10\\nGPT-3 was estimated to use 500 tons (Patterson\\net al., 2021), while Gopher required 380 tons (Rae\\net al., 2021).

Multiple masked langauge models,\\nincluding T5 (Raffel et al., 2020) and Megatron-\\nLM (Shoeybi et al., 2019), have shown consistent\\nimprovements through scale. These scaling gains\\ncome not only from growing the total number of\\nparameters in the models, but also the amount and\\nquality of pre-training data (Liu et al., 2019b; Hoff-\\nmann et al., 2022).\\nAuto-regressive language models (Mikolov et al.,\\n2009) have seen the largest growth in model size,\\nfrom 117M parameters (Radford et al., 2018) to\\nover 500B parameters (Smith et al., 2022; Chowd-\\nhery et al., 2022). The resulting massive improve-\\nment in generative ﬂuency and quality was ﬁrst\\ncharacterized in GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019) and\\nfurther improved with GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020)\\nand later models. Although a variety of very large\\n(over 100B parameters) generative models have\\nnow been trained (Lieber et al., 2021; Rae et al.,\\n2021; Thoppilan et al., 2022; Smith et al., 2022;\\nChowdhery et al., 2022), they are all closed source\\nand accessible only internally or via paid API ser-\\nvices. There are a few notable efforts towards open\\nsourcing LLMs from non-proﬁt research organiza-\\ntions including EleutherAI (Black et al., 2022) and\\nBigScience.11 These models differ from the OPT\\nmodels in pre-training data, target languages and\\nmodel scale, making it possible for the community\\nto compare different pre-training strategies.\\nSince Brown et al. (2020), the primary evalu-\\nation criterion for LLMs has been prompt-based\\n(Black et al., 2022; Rae et al., 2021; Chowdhery\\net al., 2022), as is also performed in this paper.\\nThis is largely due to the convenience of evaluat-\\ning on many tasks without specialized task-speciﬁc\\nﬁne-tuning. Prompting itself has a long history:\\ncloze evaluations go back several decades (Cham-\\nbers and Jurafsky, 2008; Mostafazadeh et al., 2016).\\nMore recently, prompting or masked inﬁlling has\\nbeen used to probe models for knowledge (Petroni\\net al., 2019) or perform a variety of NLP tasks\\n(Radford et al., 2019; Brown et al., 2020). There\\n11https://huggingface.co/bigscience/\\ntr11-176B-ml-logs/tensorboard\\nhas also been work on eliciting prompting behav-\\nior in smaller models (Schick and Schütze, 2020;\\nGao et al., 2021b; Li and Liang, 2021; Lester et al.,\\n2021; Scao and Rush, 2021), improving the ﬂexi-\\nbility of prompting (Shin et al., 2020), and under-\\nstanding why and how prompting works (Liu et al.,\\n2021; Min et al., 2022).\\nRecent efforts have shown gains by ﬁne-tuning\\nmodels to directly respond to instruction-style\\nprompting (Wei et al., 2021; Min et al., 2021; Sanh\\net al., 2021; Ouyang et al., 2022). However, ef-\\nfective prompt engineering remains an open re-\\nsearch challenge. Results vary signiﬁcantly and\\nunpredictably with the selection of the prompt (Lu\\net al., 2021), and models do not seem to understand\\nthe prompts as fully as we expect (Webson and\\nPavlick, 2021). Furthermore, it is challenging to\\nwrite prompts without a development set, which\\nleads to questions about the extent to which we\\nare actually achieving zero- or few-shot learning in\\npractice (Perez et al., 2021). We do not attempt to\\naddress these concerns of prompting, and instead\\nonly aim to provide evaluation of OPT-175B in ex-\\nisting settings. However, we hope the full release of\\nOPT-175B will enable others to better study these\\nchallenges in the future.\\n8 Conclusion\\nIn this technical report, we introduced OPT, a col-\\nlection of auto-regressive language models ranging\\nin size from 125M to 175B parameters. Our goal\\nwas to replicate the performance and sizes of the\\nGPT-3 class of models, while also applying the\\nlatest best practices in data curation and training\\nefﬁciency. We described training details, evaluated\\nperformance in a number of NLP and dialogue set-\\ntings, and characterized behaviors with respect to\\nbias, toxicity and hate speech. We also described\\nmany other limitations the models have, and dis-\\ncussed a wide set of considerations for responsibly\\nreleasing the models. We believe the entire AI\\ncommunity would beneﬁt from working together\\nto develop guidelines for responsible LLMs, and\\nwe hope that broad access to these types of models\\nwill increase the diversity of voices deﬁning the\\nethical considerations of such technologies.\\nAcknowledgements\\nWe would like to thank Scott Jeschonek, Giri Anan-\\ntharaman, Diego Sarina, Joaquin Colombo, Chris\\nBray, Stephen Roylance, Kalyan Saladi, Shubho'),\n",

We demonstrate that represent-\\ning scenes as 5D neural radiance ﬁelds (an MLP that outputs volume density and\\nview-dependent emitted radiance as a function of 3D location and 2D viewing\\ndirection) produces better renderings than the previously-dominant approach of\\ntraining deep convolutional networks to output discretized voxel representations.\\nAlthough we have proposed a hierarchical sampling strategy to make render-'),\n",

Another direction for future work is interpretability:\\nsampled representations such as voxel grids and meshes admit reasoning about\\nthe expected quality of rendered views and failure modes, but it is unclear how\\nto analyze these issues when we encode scenes in the weights of a deep neural\\nnetwork. We believe that this work makes progress towards a graphics pipeline\\nbased on real world imagery, where complex scenes could be composed of neural\\nradiance ﬁelds optimized from images of actual objects and scenes.\\nAcknowledgements We thank Kevin Cao, Guowei Frank Yang, and Nithin\\nRaghavan for comments and discussions.

Our dataset of real images contains content that can ex-\\nist anywhere between the closest point and inﬁnity, so we use normalized device\\ncoordinates to map the depth range of these points into [ −1,1]. This shifts all\\nthe ray origins to the near plane of the scene, maps the perspective rays of the\\ncamera to parallel rays in the transformed volume, and uses disparity (inverse\\ndepth) instead of metric depth, so all coordinates are now bounded.\\nTraining Details For real scene data, we regularize our network by adding'),\n",

The three layers\\nare 1×1, 3×3, and 1×1 convolutions, where the 1×1 layers\\nare responsible for reducing and then increasing (restoring)\\ndimensions, leaving the 3×3 layer a bottleneck with smaller\\ninput/output dimensions. Fig. 5 shows an example, where\\nboth designs have similar time complexity.\\nThe parameter-free identity shortcuts are particularly im-\\nportant for the bottleneck architectures. If the identity short-\\ncut in Fig. 5 (right) is replaced with projection, one can\\nshow that the time complexity and model size are doubled,\\nas the shortcut is connected to the two high-dimensional\\nends. So identity shortcuts lead to more efﬁcient models'),\n",

Motivating our use of self-attention we\\nconsider three desiderata.\\nOne is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can\\nbe parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\\nThe third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range\\ndependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the', 'convolution is equal to the combination of a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer,\\nthe approach we take in our model.\\nAs side beneﬁt, self-attention could yield more interpretable models. We inspect attention distributions\\nfrom our models and present and discuss examples in the appendix. Not only do individual attention\\nheads clearly learn to perform different tasks, many appear to exhibit behavior related to the syntactic\\nand semantic structure of the sentences.\\n5 Training\\nThis section describes the training regime for our models.\\n5.1 Training Data and Batching\\nWe trained on the standard WMT 2014 English-German dataset consisting of about 4.5 million\\nsentence pairs. Sentences were encoded using byte-pair encoding [ 3], which has a shared source-\\ntarget vocabulary of about 37000 tokens. For English-French, we used the signiﬁcantly larger WMT\\n2014 English-French dataset consisting of 36M sentences and split tokens into a 32000 word-piece', 'to averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as\\ndescribed in section 3.2.\\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions\\nof a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been\\nused successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization,\\ntextual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 27, 28, 22].\\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-\\naligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and\\nlanguage modeling tasks [34].\\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the ﬁrst transduction model relying\\nentirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-', 'Decoder: The decoder is also composed of a stack of N = 6identical layers. In addition to the two\\nsub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head\\nattention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections\\naround each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention\\nsub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This\\nmasking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the\\npredictions for position ican depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i.\\n3.2 Attention\\nAn attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output,\\nwhere the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors. The output is computed as a weighted sum']], 'uris': None, 'included': ['metadatas', 'documents', 'distances'], 'data': None, 'metadatas': [[{'source_file': 'attention.pdf', 'title': '', 'trapped': '/False', 'producer': 'pdfTeX-1.40.17', 'doc_index': 159, 'ptex.fullbanner': 'This is pdfTeX, Version 3.14159265-2.6-1.40.17 (TeX Live 2016) kpathsea version 6.2.2', 'moddate': '2021-10-30T12:18:31+05:30', 'creationdate': '2017-12-07T01:03:15+00:00', 'page': 12, 'content_length': 811, 'source': '../data/pdf/attention.pdf', 'keywords': '', 'total_pages': 15, 'subject': '', 'file_type': 'pdf', 'author': '', 'page_label': '13', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref package'}, {'doc_index': 132, 'creationdate': '2017-12-07T01:03:15+00:00', 'title': '', 'content_length': 933, 'page': 5, 'total_pages': 15, 'source_file': 'attention.pdf', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2021-10-30T12:18:31+05:30', 'source': '../data/pdf/attention.pdf', 'subject': '', 'ptex.fullbanner': 'This is pdfTeX, Version 3.14159265-2.6-1.40.17 (TeX Live 2016) kpathsea version 6.2.2', 'page_label': '6', 'file_type': 'pdf', 'producer': 'pdfTeX-1.40.17', 'trapped': '/False', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref package', 'author': ''}, {'creationdate': '2017-12-07T01:03:15+00:00', 'title': '', 'file_type': 'pdf', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref package', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2021-10-30T12:18:31+05:30', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'ptex.fullbanner': 'This is pdfTeX, Version 3.14159265-2.6-1.40.17 (TeX Live 2016) kpathsea version 6.2.2', 'total_pages': 15, 'page': 6, 'page_label': '7', 'trapped': '/False', 'doc_index': 136, 'content_length': 970, 'source': '../data/pdf/attention.pdf', 'source_file': 'attention.pdf', 'producer': 'pdfTeX-1.40.17'}, {'trapped': '/False', 'ptex.fullbanner': 'This is pdfTeX, Version 3.14159265-2.6-1.40.17 (TeX Live 2016) kpathsea version 6.2.2', 'subject': '', 'page': 1, 'producer': 'pdfTeX-1.40.17', 'creationdate': '2017-12-07T01:03:15+00:00', 'title': '', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref package', 'total_pages': 15, 'source_file': 'attention.pdf', 'doc_index': 117, 'page_label': '2', 'keywords': '', 'file_type': 'pdf', 'source': '../data/pdf/attention.pdf', 'author': '', 'content_length': 931, 'moddate': '2021-10-30T12:18:31+05:30'}, {'keywords': '', 'subject': '', 'content_length': 898, 'title': '', 'file_type': 'pdf', 'total_pages': 15, 'source': '../data/pdf/attention.pdf', 'doc_index': 121, 'page_label': '3', 'moddate': '2021-10-30T12:18:31+05:30', 'ptex.fullbanner': 'This is pdfTeX, Version 3.14159265-2.6-1.40.17 (TeX Live 2016) kpathsea version 6.2.2', 'producer': 'pdfTeX-1.40.17', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref package', 'creationdate': '2017-12-07T01:03:15+00:00', 'trapped': '/False', 'page': 2, 'author': '', 'source_file': 'attention.pdf'}]], 'distances': [[0.997269868850708, 1.0703495740890503, 1.0715922117233276, 1.1262511014938354, 1.128716230392456]]}\n",

On the ImageNet dataset we\\nevaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers—8 ×\\ndeeper than VGG nets [41] but still having lower complex-\\nity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57% error\\non the ImageNettest set. This result won the 1st place on the\\nILSVRC 2015 classiﬁcation task. We also present analysis',\n",
